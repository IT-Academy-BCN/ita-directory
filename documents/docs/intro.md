# IT Academy Directory:

The IT Academy Director is a project built with React.js and Note.js for and from students at the IT Academy from Barcelona Activa running the front-end itinerary with React.js.
One of the purposes of this project is to allow students to deal with new features, legacy code, fixes and teamwork challenges. As a consequence the priority is not only excellent technical execution, but to provide a full learning experience to our students.
